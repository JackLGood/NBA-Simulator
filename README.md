This project is an interactive tool that allows users to create, manage, and compete with custom basketball teams. The simulator supports multiple gameplay modes, including regular season, playoffs, and tournament simulations. It calculates game outcomes using sophisticated player and team rating algorithms that take into account individual statistics and team dynamics. Users can customize and add new players through an intuitive player creation interface, which updates player attributes dynamically. The project provides an immersive simulation experience by incorporating features like visually formatted brackets, leaderboards, and real-time game progress updates. Through a clean and user-friendly command-line interface, users can navigate between different functionalities, set up teams, and observe how their decisions impact game outcomes. The modular design ensures scalability, making it easy to add future features or expand the simulation's scope. By combining detailed statistical calculations with engaging gameplay mechanics, the simulator offers an entertaining and analytical exploration of basketball strategy and competition. The interface runs on the command line with rich visuals of NBA season progression.

Feel free to use, expand, and run your own simulations.
